        Challenges:
          I had issues with the handlebars at first, understanding what they were and how they related to the
          index.html file. And then how to use them. However the lectures cleared that up. The most challeging
          part of this assignment was displaying a single twit. For some reason i assumed that we needed to
          use the authors name for the url of the displayed twit as we had in the lecture. It was 2 days later when
          i read the decription of the assignment and found we had to use intergers for each different twit ranging from
          0-7. I was able to do it really quickly after that. The last thing however is somthing i couldnt entirly fix, and am
          still confused about. The insert twit. Now im sure the fuction should work but i keep getting a error that states
          either handlebars.template.___ is not a fuction or whatever variable it is assigned to is not a function.
          Overall, it can full create a new twit. But it does open the overlay and does catch you when you try to insert a twit
          without a author or text.

        <h2>
          Learned:
            How use the server.js in more detail. How to create different pages and links from a single homepage.
            how to use handlebars to eliminate the need for a index.html file. Less hard coding and more variable coding
            that allows multiple data rather than the one hard coded.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Resources:
            Lecture vidoes, lecture notes, and Google. Lots of googling was done.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Google:
            I googled some parts of the assignment, whenever i got stuck id try to work through it. Like when i
            wasnt reading in my .json file correctly in server.js. I googled different way to read in that file.
            Mostly i just watched the lecture videos, but occasionally i did need to see some example codes to get
            a better understanding of what i should be doing. They seemed to have pointed me in the right direction.
